Use this software to create a spreadhseet out of your wishes' result list on [Parcoursup](https://parcoursup.fr/).

## Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

It is very fast to get your spreadsheet. 
First edit ``setup.json`` with your own Parcoursup login. ``id`` is your file number and ``password`` is... your password ?
Then run ``python main.py`` in the command prompt with a recent enough python version (3.7 should be good), and your ``parcoursup.xlsx`` will be saved.

### Prerequisites

All you need is Python and the libraries ``bs4`` as well as ``openpyxl``.

[Install Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Go to your command prompt and type ``pip install bs4 openpyxl``.
